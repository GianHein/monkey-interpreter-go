# Monkey Interpreter

This project contains an interpreter for the Monkey programming language implemented in Golang. The project follows [Thorsten Balls](https://interpreterbook.com/) book [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com) which I'm using to get a better understanding of how programming languages work under the hood.
